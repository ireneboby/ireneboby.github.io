        <p>A webpage to create a list of 5 movie nominations. Uses the OMDB API. Built this webpage in two days after giving myself a crash course on Javascript. I set a deadline of two days and I really pushed myself to see this through. </p></div>

        <div class=" project col-12"><a href="https://www.auscse.com/camp/irene.html"><h2>My First Webpage</h2></a>
        <p>Seasoned web developers would probably double over in pain if they saw this page but we all had to start somewhere! I built this webpage after a week of teaching myself HTML5/CSS after feeling inspired at this summer camp I attended. And they were kind enough to host this page for me!</p></div>
